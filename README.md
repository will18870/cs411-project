# cs411-project

This is the main branch, and is where all project code resides.
**NOTE: The ENTIRE project code is placed in the "frontend" folder. It was not originall like this, but we ended up building the backend in the frontend folder - this was a bad practice. Sorry for any inconvenience!

###### Technology Stack

Frontend
- React 
- Vite
- TypeScript 
- TailwindCSS

Backend
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS

DB
- MongoDB

###### Dependencies

Make sure you have npm installed

###### Running the application

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
node server.js
```

You would need two terminals - one for the frontend Vite server (npm run dev), and one for the backend ExpressJS server (node server.js)
